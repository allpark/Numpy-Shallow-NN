# Vectorized Shallow (2 Layer) Neural Network Library

This project implements a two layer neural network using Python 3 and Numpy. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the module up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 


## Installing

To install this module, drop and include the following files into your project: 
1. shallow_nn.py.js
2. latest version of numpy (required)


## Functions 
### Name: shallowNN
##### Description

Creates a 2-layer Neural Net and trains it based on the provided arguments

##### Usage
> shallowNN( X, Y, num_iterations, learning_rate, print_cost)

##### Parameters

1. X - Numpy Matrix containing your training examples, with training examples stacked up in columns
